# Data Ecommerce Customer churn Machine Learning

Purwadhika's DTI Capstone Project Module 3 and 4 for Machine Learning and Cloud Computing Module

## Project Outline

### Business Problem Understanding

Covers the background, problem statement, target variable, goals, Analytics approach, metric evaluation of this machine learning model

### Data Understanding

Preparation of the project; import libraries, dataset, and summary of information dataset

### Data Cleansing

Handle duplicate and missing values, handle numerical and categorical outliers

### Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering of features column, for both categorical and numerical features. Split the data into train and test data.

### Modeling

Compare several classification algorithms to train and test data. Oversampled the data to achieve balanced data,

### Evaluation

Show the evaluation of the model, compare the result for raw data and oversampled data. Tune the hyperparameter for the model.

### Conclusion & Recommendation

Conclusion for the project and recommendations can be done in the future to improve the model accuracy.

### Export model

Export the machine learning model.

### GCP

Upload model in GCP.
